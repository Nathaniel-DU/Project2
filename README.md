# RESTAURANT FINDER üç¥üçïüçúü•ó

Find a restaurant [here](https://best-restaurant.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
Can‚Äôt decide where to eat?
We‚Äôve been there...

That‚Äôs why we created Restaurant Finder. 

An 11 question survey takes in your location, cravings, dietary restrictions, favorites and more, to help you find a restaurant in your area or town you‚Äôre visiting.

Finally put an end to the never ending‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to eat, where do you want to eat?‚Äù
 
Because we know everyone hates that conversation.

- The raw SQL query is ```CREATE DATABASE restaurant_db;```
3. Inside the config folder, open up the ```config.json``` file
- In the development object, add your MySQL localhost ```password```
4. In your terminal, ```cd``` into the project folder and run:
- ```npm install``` to download all node.js dependencies
