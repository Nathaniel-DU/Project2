# RESTAURANT FINDER üç¥üçïüçúü•ó

Find a restaurant [here](app link)

## Overview
Can‚Äôt decide where to eat?
We‚Äôve been there...

That‚Äôs why we created Restaurant Finder. 

A 10 question survey takes in your cravings, dietary restrictions, favorites and more, to help you find the right restaurant in your area or town you‚Äôre visiting.

Finally put an end to the never ending‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to eat, where do you want to eat?‚Äù
 
Because we know everyone hates that conversation.
